This repository aims for an easy to manage Russian word pool organized as a collection of yaml-files. Each word has one yaml-file with all its information.

The `main.py` generates a csv-table from the folder `output`.

I used `csv_to_yaml.py` to create a starting point from a csv-table, that I put together in a rather cumbersome process.
